# REACT-LESSONS-INSTRUCTOR-ANDRES-R.-BUCHELI

## Take a look to the live example at:
https://bucheli-web-development-react-course-passing-event-as-props.netlify.app/

## Usage:
* Rendering all the page from an main component (Talker.js).
* Creating an index entry point for all the application.
* Import the main component (Talker) into the index file.
* Import components into the App component.
* Passing props from the parent component to the child component.
* The child component access the data via this.props.(name of the prop).
* Rendering different UI based on props.
* Passing event handlers as props.
* <strong>Notice that in this example, you can see that we can pass the props with any name (talk in this case) and this is the name that we need to use when receiving the props in the child component.</strong>
